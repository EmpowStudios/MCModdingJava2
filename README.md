# MCModdingJava
Made for Empow Instructors as a reference for the end result of the curiculum.

It is a "cheat sheet" for Empow instructors designed to show the end result for a badge submission. If you are training to teach this track it is highly recommended
that you first try completing the curriculum that way you will understand better how things work when building a mod. Through debugging your code you will develop
a better understand of how Minecraft registers and compiles code. This will better help you in tracking bugs more efficiently for when a student is struggling.
Of course, do not share this repository with any student.

Feel free to contribute and create branches to add more content to the main branch.
